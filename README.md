# PnC
## nPr Formula
The formula to find the value of nPr is:

nPr = n!/(n-r)!
Note: The symbol (!) indicates factorial.

Note: The permutation (nPr) value shows the number of ways to arrange r things out of n.

## nCr Formula
The formula to find the value of nCr is:

nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!

Note: The combination (nCr) value shows the number of ways to select r things out of n.
